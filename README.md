# Gesture-Keyboard-Traj-Gen
Simulating Realistic Human Motion Trajectories of Mid-Air Gesture Typing

Four different models to generate synthesized data are implemented. Each of the different models can be used for different scenarios. For the RNN-based model implementation, two implemnetations are provided with each built on Tensorflow 1 and Tensorflow 2 respectively. This gives reader more flexibility to replicate the experiements and use the generation tools.
