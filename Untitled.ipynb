    "## Simulating Realistic Human Motion Trajectories of Mid-Air Gesture Typing\n",
    "\n",
    "The eventual success of many AR and VR intelligent interactive systems relies on the ability to collect user motion data at large scale.\n",
    "Realistic simulation of human motion trajectories is a potential solution to this problem. \n",
    "Simulated user motion data can facilitate prototyping and speed up the design process.\n",
    "There are also potential benefits in augmenting training data for deep learning-based AR/VR applications to improve performance.\n",
    "However, the generation of realistic motion data is nontrivial. \n",
    "In this paper, we examine the specific challenge of simulating index finger movement data to inform mid-air gesture keyboard design. The mid-air gesture keyboard is deployed on an optical see-through display that allows the user to enter text by articulating word gesture patterns with their physical index finger in the vicinity of a visualized keyboard layout.\n",
    "We propose and compare four differen approaches to simulating this type of motion data, including a Jerk-Minimization model, a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)-based generative model, and a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)-based model with two modes: style transfer and data alteration.\n",
    "We also introduce a procedure for validating the quality of the generated trajectories in terms of realism and diversity.\n",
    "The GAN-based model shows significant potential for generating synthetic motion trajectories to facilitate design and deep learning for advanced gesture keyboards deployed in AR and VR. \n",
    "\n",
    "The implementations in this repository can enable readers better replicate our experiments and use the models as a rapid synthetic tools. \n"

    "- **Common** \n",
    "  - *Knots (t1,...,tM)* : time knots. In case of polyTrajGen, it defines the segment intervals in time domain. *The fix-pin can be imposed on these time knots* (no limitation for loose pin). In case of optimTrajGen, the time knot is just the start time and end time as it is not defined on a set of time sgements. \n",
    "  - *Penality weights for the integral of derivative squared* : as the objective of our optimization is the weighted sum of the integral of derivative squared, we have to define the importance weight for each component. This value ws = [w1 w2 ... wd] can be set as the argument of setDerivativeObj(ws). For example, if you want to implement a minimum snap trajectory generation, then set ws = [0 0 0 1] while ws = [0 0 1] for minimum jerk trajectory generation.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **polyTrajGen**\n",
    "  - *Polynomial order (N)* : the order of all the polynomial segments. Although it can increase the power of representation of a curve, the size of optimization variables increases in proportion to (N x M).   \n",
    "  \n",
    "  - *Optimization target* (*'end-derivative'* or *'poly-coeff'*) : the target of optimization. 'poly-coeff' method sets the coefficients of polynomials as optimization variables in a similar way with [1]. The 'end-derivative' sets the optimization variables as the free derivative values of each end point on a polynomial segment. As this method is equivalent to plugging the equality constraints (fix pin and continuity) to optimization problem, it reduces the optimization dimension at the cost of inversion of a mapping matrix. The dof of a segment is thus (poly_order - # of fix pins on the segment - maximal continuity). For the details, please refer [2].   \n",
    "    \n",
    "  - *Maximum continuity* : the maximally imposed continuity order between neighboring segements. Higher value of this parameter enhances the quality of smoothness. However, too high value of this value restricts the dof for optimization, downgrading the opitimization result.     \n",
    "  \n",
    "- **optimTrajGen**\n",
    "   - *Point density* : the number of posed points per time [s]. For long-ranged trajectory, thus, the total number of variables will increase leading to the burden of the optimization. \n",
